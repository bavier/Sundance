\subsection conf_trilinos Configuring and Building Trilinos for Sundance 

You downloaded version 6 of Trilinos
right? If you got
some other release, please go back now and get  
<A HREF="http://software.sandia.gov/trilinos/downloads/trilinos-6.0.html"> version 6 </A> 

The installation procedure for Trilinos is well-documented 
<A HREF="http://software.sandia.gov/Trilinos/installation_manual.html">
here, </A>
however, it may not be obvious which options should be set 
to work with Sundance. Information on which Trilinos packages should be enabled
plus sample configuration scripts are found on this page: 
\ref conf_trilinos_page .



\subsection conf_tri_example Example Trilinos Installation 

Here we show an example of installing Trilinos. We will configure it
for use with Sundance with settings appropriate to debugging.

Trilinos is unpacked into a directory tagged by the minor version number, 
for example, <tt>trilinos-6.0.18</tt>. The minor version number 6.0.18 appears
in all examples below; it should of course be changed to the minor version
number of your Trilinos installation.

It is assumed that you have installed BLAS, LAPACK, and any optional
libraries such as MPI.
It is assumed you have downloaded Trilinos and unpacked the source into
some directory; in this example, we will work in a Trilinos directory
<tt>$HOME/Software/Math/trilinos-6.0.18.</tt> As is explained in the Trilinos
installation guide, Trilinos should always be configured and built in a 
build directory, <b>not</b> in the Trilinos source directory. In this
example, we work in a build directory 
<tt>$HOME/Software/Math/trilinos-6.0.18/LINUX-OPT.</tt>

The installation process is listed below for a case where you are using one
of the \ref canned_scripts on the \ref conf_trilinos_page .
\code
<kevin@rusalka:Software/Math/trilinos-6.0.18> mkdir LINUX-OPT 
<kevin@rusalka:Software/Math/trilinos-6.0.18> cd LINUX-OPT 
<kevin@rusalka:Software/Math/trilinos-6.0.18/LINUX-OPT> ./sundance-linux-mpi-opt
<kevin@rusalka:Software/Math/trilinos-6.0.18/LINUX-OPT> make
<kevin@rusalka:Software/Math/trilinos-6.0.18/LINUX-OPT> make install
\endcode

The final step puts libraries and headers into the installation directory 
specified in the configuration script; the sample script used here
installs into the build directory. Thus in this example, headers and
libraries are found in the <tt>include</tt> and <tt>lib</tt> subdirectories
of <tt>HOME/Software/Math/trilinos-6.0.18/LINUX-OPT.</tt> The installation
directory can be changed with the <tt>--prefix</tt> configure option. 


\subsection conf_tri_sun Note on Concurrent Development of Trilinos and Sundance

The default installation behavior updates timestamps on header files
so that if any Trilinos header file is changed, many Sundance files
will have to be rebuilt. This is inconvenient for those people
who use Sundance while doing Trilinos development, for instance solver
researchers using Sundance as a testbed, because it forces many unnecessary
rebuilds of the entire Sundance distribution. On some systems,
timestamps on unchanged files
can be preserved through installation, so that only those Sundance files
dependent on those Trilinos files that have actually changed need be rebuilt.
On Linux, timestamps can be preserved with the <tt>-p</tt> option
to <tt>install</tt>, which can be imposed by adding the option
<tt>--with-install="/usr/bin/install -c -p"</tt> to the configure command line.
This is done in the sample scripts in the Trilinos distribution.


\section conf_sundance Configuring Sundance

Once Trilinos is built and installed, we can configure, build, and install
Sundance. During the Sundance build process, <tt>configure</tt>
and <tt>make</tt> must
know where to find headers and libraries for Trilinos. This is
done through the <tt>--with-trilinos</tt> option to <tt>configure.</tt> With the 
example Trilinos installation above, you would add 
<tt>--with-trilinos=+\$\verb+HOME/Software/Math/trilinos-6.0.18/LINUX-OPT</tt>
to the <tt>configure</tt>
command line. If you have installed
Trilinos somewhere else, you should change your 
<tt>configure</tt> line accordingly.

There are several sample configuration script in the <tt>build-scripts</tt>
subdirectory of Sundance. 
<ul>
<li> <tt>build-scripts/linux-mpi-debug</tt> configures parallel Sundance
on Linux with debugging flags set and array bounds checking. This
script assumes that you have installed Trilinos in
<tt>HOME/Software/Math/trilinos-6.0.18/LINUX-DEBUG.</tt>
<li> <tt>build-scripts/linux-mpi-opt</tt> configures parallel Sundance
on Linux with compile-time optimization and no debugging information
or array bounds checking. This
script assumes that you have installed Trilinos in
<tt>HOME/Software/Math/trilinos-6.0.18/LINUX-OPT.</tt>
</ul>
These scripts can be used as a starting 
point for other modes of building Sundance. 

An example installation process is listed below. 
\code
<kevin@rusalka:Projects/Sundance> mkdir LINUX-OPT 
<kevin@rusalka:Projects/Sundance> cd LINUX-OPT 
<kevin@rusalka:Projects/Sundance/LINUX-OPT> ../build-scripts/linux-mpi-opt
<kevin@rusalka:Projects/Sundance/LINUX-OPT> make
<kevin@rusalka:Projects/Sundance/LINUX-OPT> make install
\endcode

\section conf_test Testing your build

After building, you can run standard tests to make sure all is well:
\code
<kevin@rusalka:Projects/Sundance/LINUX-OPT> make tests
\endcode
This will run a suite of test problems. If you have built with MPI, all
tests will be run in serial, and then a subset of the tests
will be run in parallel. By default, the parallel tests are run
on two processors, but you can change that with an argument to make, e.g., 
\code
<kevin@rusalka:Projects/Sundance/LINUX-OPT> make NPROC=4 tests
\endcode
will run the parallel tests on 4 processors.


\section conf_py_env Setting your environment to run a PySundance simulator

The easiest way to build simulators is with PySundance. You don't need
to worry about makefiles, all you need to do is install (following the instructions above) and then set your Python path to the installation directory
for the PySundance shared libraries. The subdirectory name will depend
on your installation; it will be a subdirectory of python/src/build. 
For example,
\code
<kevin@rusalka> setenv PYTHON_PATH /home/kevin/Projects/Sundance/LINUX-OPT/python/src/build/lib.linux-i686-2.4/PySundance
\endcode
You can put this in your .cshrc file to have the path automatically set
when opening a new shell.


\section conf_app Setting up makefiles to develop a C++-based Sundance application

The previous installation steps have configured and built the Sundance
libraries, tests, and examples. You are probably interested in using Sundance
to develop your own application, for which you will need to write
a Makefile that can access the Sundance libraries. 

\subsection conf_app_example A simple application makefile example

A template for a simple
application makefile is in <tt>Makefile.sample,</tt> found in the root 
directory of the Sundance distribution. For many Sundance-based 
applications it will be 
sufficient to copy this makefile and set one variable:
<tt>SUNDANCE_INSTALL_DIR,</tt> which should point to the directory where you
have installed Sundance.

In the following example, you are building the <tt>PostPotentialFlow</tt>
simulator (described in detail below) in the directory <tt>MyApps.</tt>
First put the application source (and any other required files such as meshes)
in your application directory:
\code
<kevin@rusalka:MyApps> cp ~/Projects/Sundance/examples-tutorial/PostPotentialFlow.cpp .
<kevin@rusalka:MyApps> cp ~/Projects/Sundance/examples-tutorial/post.ncdf .
<kevin@rusalka:MyApps> cp ~/Projects/Sundance/Makefile.sample Makefile
\endcode
Now, edit <tt>Makefile</tt> and set <tt>SUNDANCE_INSTALL_DIR</tt>
to the location
of your Sundance build. The next step is to build the application:
\code
<kevin@rusalka:MyApps> make PostPotentialFlow.exe
\endcode
Your application is now ready to run.

If your application requires more than one source file, additional
objects to be compiled and linked can be specified in the 
<tt>EXTRA_OBJS</tt> macro. For more complicated application structures,
see the next section.

\subsection conf_app_ryo Rolling your own application Makefile

If the sample makefile described above is not sufficient for your application,
you can access the <tt>make</tt> macros for Sundance directly by including
in your makefile the file <tt>Makefile.export,</tt> which is written
into your build subdirectory at configure time. This makefile fragment contains
definitions of the Sundance and Trilinos header and library search paths, 
compiler options, and so on. If you are rolling your own Makefile, I assume
you know enough about makefiles to set it up without further instruction 
from me.
