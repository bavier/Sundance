    /**
     * Class EvaluatableExpr provides common functionality for
     * management of caching evaluation results, preprocessing
     * to determine the sparsity pattern of the matrix of functional
     * derivatives, and part of the interface for evaluation of expressions.
     *
     * Evaluatable expression subtypes may use multiple inheritance.
     * EvaluatableExpr contains many data structures that should
     * only exist once per object, so EvaluatableExpr is a virtual
     * base class. Classes deriving from EvaluatableExpr should use
     * virtual public inheritance.
     *
     * Evaluation is a logically const operation, and preprocessing
     * is an implementation detail, so most evaluation and preprocessing
     * related methods of EvaluatableExpr are declared const, and
     * the internal data is declared mutable.
     *
     * <h3> Sparsity determination </h3>
     *
     * It is important to know the sparsity structure of the matrix
     * of partial functional derivatives. To determine whether an
     * EvaluatableExpr* <tt>e</tt> has a nonzero partial derivative
     * <tt>d,</tt> call <tt>e->hasNonzeroDeriv(d).</tt>
     *
     * Since sparsity determination does take some time in a complicated
     * expression, the nonzeroness of a given derivative is cached
     * once determined. The cache object is derivNonzeronessCache_,
     * which is declared mutable to maintain the logical constness
     * of hasNonzeroDeriv().
     *
     * <h3> Description of sparsity structure </h3>
     *
     * Information about exactly which derivatives are nonzero
     * and required
     * at a given node in a given region is
     * stored in a SparsityPattern object. Since the derivatives required
     * will depend on region, there will be a SparsityPattern
     * object for each region, or more precisely for each set of multiple
     * derivatives required at the root.
     *
     * A SparsityPattern object describes the set of all derivatives
     * that will be nonzero during the course of a particular
     * root-level evaluate() call. At nodes farther down the graph,
     * some of those derivatives may become zero. To simplify the
     * bookkeeping by preserving consistent numbering between many
     * nodes, the SparsityPattern object still includes those
     * derivatives but marks them with a ZeroDeriv value of a
     * DerivState enum. Other derivatives may be identifiable as
     * constant at a node, in which case they are marked with a
     * ConstantDeriv state. Derivatives that are nonzero and
     * non-constant are marked with a VectorDeriv state.
     *
     * <h3> Evaluation </h3>
     *
     * The interface for evaluation is the evaluate() method. 
     * Arguments are
     * a const reference to an EvalManager and
     * a smart pointer to a EvalVectorArray. The EvalManager
     * EvalManager is to supply any provide callbacks for evaluation of objects
     * such as discrete functions which require knowledge of the
     * mesh and field data structures to be carried out. The
     * EvalVectorArray object contains vectors for the results of
     * all functional derivatives evaluated at this node.
     *
     *
     * <h4> Managing multiple calls during evaluation </h4>
     *
     * Since expressions have shallow copy behavior,
     * any expression object may
     * appear multiple times in an expression graph, and thus during an
     * evaluation of that graph some node may have their evaluate()
     * methods called multiple times. Clearly it is wasteful to
     * repeatedly evaluate the same expression, so a system for
     * avoiding multiple evaluations is required.
     *
     * Consider the sequence of expressions \code Expr d = a + b;
     * Expr e = a + c*d + sqrt(d); \endcode Upon evaluation of
     * <tt>e</tt>, there will clearly be one call to c.evaluate()
     * and two to d.evaluate(). But how many calls are there to
     * a.evaluate() and b.evaluate()? Both are called once in the
     * evaluation of d, but then a.evaluate() is called one more
     * time in the evaluation of e. However, since we will cache d's
     * value, any subsequent calls to d.evaluate() will not
     * recursively call a.evaluate(). So the number of evaluate()
     * calls for each of \f$\{a,b,c,d\}\f$ is \f$\{2,1,1,2\}\f$.
     *
     * The number of calls to each node's evaluate during an
     * evaluation of the root node is the number of edges
     * entering the node from above in the expression graph.
     * This can be computed as in the following pseudocode:
     * \code
     * 1. Initialize all nodes' reference counts to zero
     * 2. Call root->resetReferenceCount(), where
     *
     * void resetReferenceCount()
     * {
     *   increment refCount;
     *   if (refCount == 1)
     *   {
     *     for all children {child->resetReferenceCount();}
     *   }
     * }
     * \endcode
     * During a subsequent evaluation, if a node's reference count
     * is greater than zeo then its value should be copied into a cache
     * for further use. Each call to evaluate() decrements the reference
     * count, and when the count reaches zero the storage allocated
     * for the cached values can be placed back on a stack and
     * later reused.
